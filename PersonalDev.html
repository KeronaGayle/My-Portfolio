<h3>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h3>
<p>In this chapter, the authors emphasize that having goals is essential for direction and growth. They explain that goals act as a roadmap, guiding us toward the future we want instead of leaving life to chance. What stood out to me is the idea that without clearly defined goals, we risk drifting without purpose. Personally, I can align this lesson to my own academic and career journey. By setting specific short-term goals, like completing assignments on time and mastering programming concepts, I can stay on track with my long-term ambition of becoming a skilled computer scientist. This reminds me that goals should be written down, measurable, and revisited often to keep me focused.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h3>
<p>This chapter explains the importance of managing time wisely, pointing out that time is a non-renewable resource. The message is that wasting time is essentially wasting potential, while disciplined time use creates opportunities for success. For me, this applies directly to balancing schoolwork, fitness, and personal development. I sometimes procrastinate, but reading this reminded me that even small chunks of wasted time can add up. I need to structure my day more efficiently, like setting aside uninterrupted study blocks and limiting distractions from social media. By being intentional with time, I can increase productivity and reduce unnecessary stress.</p>

<h3>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
<p>In this chapter, Rohn and Widener highlight the influence of the people we spend time with. They argue that our associations shape our habits, attitudes, and ultimately our success. Positive, driven people encourage growth, while negative influences hold us back. This resonates with me because I have noticed how surrounding myself with motivated classmates or supportive friends pushes me to do better. On the other hand, being around people who lack ambition can affect my mindset negatively. Moving forward, I want to be more intentional about building relationships with people who share my values and aspirations.</p>

<h3>Chapter 7: Be a Lifelong Learner</h3>
<p>Rohn and Widener (2005) emphasize the critical importance of continuous learning, beyond formal education. They argue that growth requires curiosity, humility, and the willingness to expand knowledge throughout life. This principle aligns perfectly with my current stage as a student in computer science, where technology evolves rapidly. Committing to lifelong learning means I cannot rely solely on what I learn in the classroom but must continuously upskill through self-study, online resources, certifications, and practical experiences. Beyond academics, being a lifelong learner also applies to personal developmentâ€”reading books on leadership, communication, or spirituality enriches my overall growth. By embracing this mindset, I position myself not just for career success, but for becoming a well-rounded individual who adapts to change with resilience.
