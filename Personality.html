        <h2> Top Three Personality Traits & Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            My top three strongest personality traits are determination, discipline, and creativity.
            Determination drives me to keep pushing through challenges, whether it’s studying for exams
            or completing assignments under pressure. Discipline helps me stay consistent with my schoolwork,
            ensuring I meet deadlines and balance academic responsibilities with my personal life.
            Creativity allows me to approach problems from different perspectives, especially when working
            on projects or coding tasks in Computer Science. These traits, along with hobbies like fitness
            training and exploring new technologies, positively influence my academic life by keeping me focused,
            motivated, and open to innovative solutions.

        <h2> Favourite Quote & Hero </h2>
        <p>
            One of my favourite quotes comes from Ackeem Campbell, popularly known as Chronic Law,
            a Jamaican dancehall artiste. The quote is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “Mummy seh fi work hard, if uh give up uh nuh know wah uh want.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Chronic Law grew up in St. Thomas, Jamaica, and built his career despite many challenges.
            He is admired for his lyrical talent, authenticity, and ability to inspire youth through his music.
            This quote resonates with me because it reminds me of the importance of perseverance and staying
            focused on my goals, no matter how hard life gets. I consider him my hero because his story shows
            resilience, discipline, and belief in hard work—qualities I also try to live by.

        <h2>AI Businesses of 2025 Blog Report </h2>
        <p>
            After reviewing the blog “AI Businesses of 2025”, the idea that stood out to me the most was
            <strong>AI in Healthcare Diagnostics</strong>. This concept focuses on using Artificial Intelligence
            to quickly analyze medical data, identify patterns, and assist doctors in diagnosing illnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe this would be very useful in Jamaica and the wider Caribbean, where access to healthcare
            specialists can be limited. AI diagnostic tools could reduce waiting times, improve accuracy in detecting
            conditions like diabetes or cancer, and provide faster treatment options for patients.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there are ethical concerns such as patient data privacy, potential bias in AI algorithms,
            and the risk of over-reliance on AI instead of professional judgment. To solve these issues, the
            company should enforce strict data protection policies, ensure diverse and unbiased training data,
            and design AI tools that support not replace medical professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of a real-world app in this area is
            <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson-health" target="_blank">IBM Watson Health</a>,
            which applies AI to assist doctors with data-driven insights for better patient care.
